# ![toolkit](images/toolkit.png)

toolkit is a JavaScript widget library with special focus on building
low latency user interfaces for audio applications. It contains a wide range
of widgets such as faders, knobs, levelmeters and equalizers.

## Design Goals

toolkit is written in pure JavaScript and has no external dependencies.
It is supposed to run in browsers which support ECMAScript 5 including
IE9. toolkit was designed to be lightweight and fast while keeping the
full flexibility which comes with CSS. toolkit widgets offer consistent
and intuitive APIs.

## Documentation

The complete API documentation can be found at [http://deuso.de/toolkit/docs/].
The documentation contains interactive examples for many Widgets.

Alternatively, the documentation can be directly built from the source code.
The documentation in the source files uses the common jsdoc syntax and [JSDoc 3](https://usejsdoc.org).
can be used to generate the documentation. If you have jsdoc installed, simply run

    make jsdoc
