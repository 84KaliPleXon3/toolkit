toolkit is a VanillaJS JavaScript widget toolkit for professional audio
and broadcast applications. toolkit is  supposed to run in browsers like
IE9+, Chrome and Firefox.

toolkit is missing some features and hides some bugs by now and is under
heavy development. A version number is still missing. 

**toolkit is still considered broken! Please wait until there's the
first version number available**
